# Create new flags
Creating feature flags in a project will allow you to access them through REST API. Since they are stored in redis, the retrieval is faster.

- Open the project that you want to create feature flags in.
- Click on **Create Flag** button.
- Enter the name of the feature flag and its value.
- Click on **Create Flag** or hit Enter.
- The desired feature flag is created.
